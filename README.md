# GenericTestApplication

This is an attempt to create an quiz application that uploads a single text file with questions and answers to quiz the knowledge of the information contained in the file.

The project is written in Java in Android Studio, mainly because I can't figure out how to create a virtual machine in Visual Studio (I know, I know, don't, please). That being said, its purpose is mainly to help me pass various MCSA exams and as such, if and when I have time I will translate this application to C# and Xamarin Forms. 

The application started out as shown in the videos of Coding with Sara on youtube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heYW4aycTn0&list=PLRdMAPi4QUfbEk4NfsImoUMudvxBI0bov&index=2) and I am eternally grateful for their videos, which have helped me out quite a bit.
